# Undergrad

College is a crazy time in a young person's life. Although attended under the
pretense of "learning," there is a whole lot more that happens. This video
game (while no substitute for the real deal) is mean to be a tutorial in the
fast-paced world of university. From doing your homework, to "fratting-it-up"
this game has it all.

If by "doing your homework" you mean shooting fireballs at it.

It's a metaphor...

## Features

This is a really trite video game. It's mostly an "academic" (lol) exercise.
But it'll be really cool someday! This section will be so full of cool things.
You'll all see...

## Contact

If you really, really, really want to talk about how terrible this game is
then feel free to [report an issue](https://github.com/rsnively/Undergrad/issues?state=open) .

Maybe I'll read it. Okay. I'll definitely read it, but I might not take
it very well.

With that in mind, feel free to share / use anything you find on here. Let me know if you like what you see!
